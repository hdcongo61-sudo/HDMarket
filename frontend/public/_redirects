# SPA fallback: serve index.html for all routes so client-side routing works
# Required for direct links and page refresh (e.g. /top-deals, /login)
# 200 = rewrite (return index.html but keep the URL)
# Used by Netlify and similar hosts. On Render: add in Dashboard → Static Site →
# Redirects/Rewrites: Source "/*", Destination "/index.html", Action "Rewrite"
/*    /index.html   200
